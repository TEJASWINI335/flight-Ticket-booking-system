The Flight Booking System (FBS) designed using a Database Management System (DBMS) is a comprehensive solution that efficiently manages various aspects of flight operations. The system supports activities such as flight scheduling, passenger bookings, ticketing, payments, and airport management, all through a well-structured relational database.
One of the core functionalities of the system is flight and booking management. It tracks detailed information about flights, such as flight number, flight name, departure time, and arrival time. The Booking table ensures that each booking is accurately recorded, allowing for a complete history of passenger flight reservations and their current status (confirmed, pending, or canceled).
Another key aspect of the system is passenger and ticket management. The system stores detailed records of passengers, including personal information and their associated bookings. The Ticket table stores information about ticket numbers, prices, and issue dates, linking each ticket to a specific booking. This relationship facilitates easy tracking of the ticketing process and payment status. Payment management is also an integral part of the system. The Payment table records payment transactions, including the payment method, amount, and date of payment for each ticket issued. Finally, the Airport table stores information about the airports, including their names and locations, which are essential for connecting flights to specific departure and arrival locations.
In conclusion, the DBMS-based Flight Booking System provides a robust and efficient platform for managing flight schedules, passenger bookings, ticketing, payments, and airport information. Its well-structured database design ensures data integrity, easy access to information, and the ability to scale as needed, making it an effective tool for airlines and travel agencies.
